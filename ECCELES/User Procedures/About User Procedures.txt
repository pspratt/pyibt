This is a special folder.

You can put Igor procedure files in here or shortcuts pointing to procedure
files or to folders containing procedure files. If, when Igor is compiling
procedures, it comes across a line of the following form:

#include "a file name"

Igor will look in this folder and in any sub-folders for a procedure file
of named "a file name.ipf".

Igor will also look at any files or folders referenced by shortcuts.
If the procedure file is found, Igor will automatically open it,
if it is not already open.

Such procedure files are called "shared" procedure files.

NOTE:
  If you put a procedure file in this folder and then use its procedures
  in an experiment then that experiment will rely the procedure file's presence.
  If you transfer the experiment to another computer, you will need
  to transfer the procedure file also. If you forget the procedure
  file then the experiment will not work on the other computer.

NOTE:
  It is best if you save your own files in your own folder outside the
  Igor Pro Folder. This makes it possible for you to upgrade Igor in the
  future without worrying about losing your own files. To facilite this,
  create a folder named Igor Shared Procedures outside the Igor Pro folder.
  Now make a shortcut for your Igor Shared Procedures folder, and drag it
  into the User Procedures folder. When Igor compiles a #include statement,
  it will look for the file in your Igor Shared Procedures folder, or in any
  a subfolder.
